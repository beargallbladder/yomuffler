## ðŸŽ¯ **Core Bayesian Formula**

### **Bayes' Theorem for Battery Failure Prediction:**
```
P(Failure|Evidence) = [P(Evidence|Failure) Ã— P(Failure)] / P(Evidence)
```

### **Likelihood Ratio Form (More Stable):**
```
Posterior Odds = Prior Odds Ã— Likelihood Ratio

Where:
- Prior Odds = P(Failure) / (1 - P(Failure))
- Likelihood Ratio = Product of all active stressor LRs
- Posterior Probability = Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds)
```

## ðŸ“Š **Argonne-Sourced Priors**

### **Base Failure Rates by Cohort:**
```
Light Truck (Midwest Winter):      P(Failure) = 0.15 (15%)
Midweight Truck (Southwest Heat):  P(Failure) = 0.12 (12%)
Passenger Car (Northeast Mixed):   P(Failure) = 0.09 (9%)
SUV Commercial Fleet:              P(Failure) = 0.18 (18%)
```

## âš¡ **Argonne ANL-115925.pdf Validated Likelihood Ratios**

### **Critical Finding: 6-Mile Recharge Rule**
**Argonne Discovery:** "Approximately six miles of driving needed to recharge battery after start"
```
Short Trip Behavior LR = 1.9
Definition: Average trip < 6 miles, insufficient recharge time
Mathematical Impact: Increases failure odds by 90%
```

### **Ignition Cycle Validation**
**Argonne Finding:** "Ignition cycle count alone doesn't reduce life, lack of recharge between starts is the killer"
```
Ignition Cycles High LR = 2.3
Definition: â‰¥40 ignition events/30 days with inadequate recharge
Mathematical Impact: Increases failure odds by 130%
```

### **Deep Discharge Penalties**
**Argonne Research:** "Engine-off accessory loads during engine-off events cause exponential degradation"
```
Engine-Off-to-On Under 1hr LR = 1.5
Definition: <1hr rest between trips for >15% of starts
Mathematical Impact: Increases failure odds by 50%
```

## ðŸ”¥ **Temperature-Based Likelihood Ratios**

```
Temperature Extreme Hot LR = 1.8
Definition: Average temp >90Â°F over 30-day period

### **Cold Stress (Peukert Law)**
```
Cold Extreme LR = 1.2

## ðŸ§® **Step-by-Step Mathematical Example**

### **Example Vehicle: 2022 F-150, Miami FL, High Stressor Load**

#### **Step 1: Cohort Assignment**
```
Vehicle: 2022 Ford F-150
Location: Miami, FL (coastal_hot)
Cohort: lighttruck_midwest_winter â†’ Prior = 0.15 (15%)
```

#### **Step 2: Convert Prior to Odds**
```
Prior Odds = P(Failure) / (1 - P(Failure))
Prior Odds = 0.15 / (1 - 0.15) = 0.15 / 0.85 = 0.176
```

#### **Step 3: Identify Active Stressors**
```
Active Stressors Detected:
âœ… temp_extreme_hot        LR = 1.8  (Miami heat)
âœ… short_trip_behavior     LR = 1.9  (Urban driving <6 miles)
âœ… ignition_cycles_high    LR = 2.3  (Frequent starts)
```

#### **Step 4: Calculate Combined Likelihood Ratio**
```
Combined LR = 1.8 Ã— 1.9 Ã— 2.3 = 7.866
```

#### **Step 5: Apply Bayesian Update**
```
Posterior Odds = Prior Odds Ã— Combined LR
Posterior Odds = 0.176 Ã— 7.866 = 1.384
```

#### **Step 6: Convert Back to Probability**
```
Posterior Probability = Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds)
Posterior Probability = 1.384 / (1 + 1.384) = 1.384 / 2.384 = 0.581

FINAL RESULT: 58.1% probability of battery failure
```

## ðŸ“ˆ **Real Calculation from Your System**

### **From VIN Database (Lead #40):**
```
VIN: 1FMZRW1E0LR799228
Customer: John Martinez (Explorer SUV, Pensacola FL)
Cohort: suv_coastal_hot

Mathematical Breakdown:
Prior = 0.12 (12% SUV baseline)
Prior Odds = 0.12 / 0.88 = 0.136

Active Stressors:
- temperature_cycling: 2.16
- short_trips: 1.9  
- soc_decline: 6.5

Combined LR = 2.16 Ã— 1.9 Ã— 6.5 = 26.68

Posterior Odds = 0.136 Ã— 26.68 = 3.629
Posterior Probability = 3.629 / 4.629 = 0.784

RESULT: 78.4% failure probability (matches your data!)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Severity Classification (Academic Thresholds)**

```
SEVERE:    â‰¥25% (Argonne: Immediate intervention required)
CRITICAL:  20-25% (High probability, urgent attention)
HIGH:      15-20% (Above baseline, priority scheduling)
MODERATE:  8-15% (Monitor closely, next maintenance)
LOW:       <8% (Routine maintenance schedule)
```

---

## ðŸ”¬ **Mathematical Validation Checks**

### **Bounds Enforcement:**
```python
# Ensure numerical stability
posterior_prob = max(0.001, min(0.999, posterior_probability))

# Handle division by zero
prior_odds = prior / (1 - prior + 1e-10)
```

### **Likelihood Ratio Constraints:**
```python
# Extreme LR detection (reduces confidence)
if combined_lr > 5.0 or combined_lr < 0.2:
    confidence *= 0.85  # Flag unusual combinations
```

### **Academic Source Tracking:**
```python
academic_sources = [
    cohort.prior_source,  # "Argonne DOE 2015 Study"
    stressor.source       # "Argonne ANL-115925.pdf Section 4.1"
]
```

## ðŸ“Š **Statistical Interpretation**

### **Prior Interpretation:**
- **15% Light Truck Prior**: In academic studies, 15 out of 100 similar vehicles experienced battery failure within 5 years under baseline conditions

### **Likelihood Ratio Interpretation:**
- **LR = 2.3**: Vehicles with this stressor are 2.3Ã— more likely to fail than vehicles without it
- **Combined LR = 7.866**: This specific combination of stressors makes failure 7.866Ã— more likely

### **Posterior Interpretation:**
- **58.1% Posterior**: Given the observed stressor pattern, there's a 58.1% probability this specific vehicle will experience battery failure

## ðŸš€ **Business Intelligence Layer**

### **Revenue Calculations:**
```python
# Cohort-specific revenue multipliers
if cohort.region == "Commercial":
    revenue *= 1.8  # Commercial vehicles = higher service value

# Model-specific adjustments  
if model in ["F-150", "Super Duty"]:
    revenue *= 1.2  # Premium models = premium pricing
```

### **Confidence Scoring:**
```python
# Multi-factor confidence calculation
confidence = cohort_match_confidence Ã— data_quality Ã— stressor_reliability
```
